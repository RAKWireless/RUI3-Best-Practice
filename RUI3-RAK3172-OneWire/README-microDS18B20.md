### Work with a sensor
#### without addressing
In this mode, one sensor is connected to one PIN MK, it does not require a preliminary reading of the address and write it to the program to work with it.
You can connect several sensors, indicate each PIN, see example *One_pin_one_Sensor *.
```CPP
Microds18b20 <PIN1> Sensor1;
Microds18b20 <PIN2> Sensor2;
// ... and so on
```

### with addressing
In this mode, you can connect as many sensors to one PIN MK, but to work with them you will need to bring unique sensors addresses into the program.
At the time of reading the address to Pin, only one sensor must be connected!Example - *Address_read *.
For further work, the addresses are stored in arrays on the side of the program and transmitted to the sensors during initialization, the PIN is indicated the same:
```CPP
uint8_t addr1 [{0x28, 0xff, 0xcd, 0x59, 0x51, 0x17, 0x4, 0xfe};
uint8_t addr2 [] = {0x28, 0xff, 0x36, 0x94, 0x65, 0x15, 0x2, 0x80};

Microds18b20 <Pin, Addr1> Sensor1;
Microds18b20 <Pin, Addr2> SensoR2;
// ... and so on
```
Also, the address can be changed during the program, see the documentation above.

#### Reading Temperature
Reading the temperature is divided into two stages - a request and obtaining data.The request is made by the `REQUESTEMP ()` function.After receiving the request
The sensor begins a temperature measurement, which lasts from 90 to 750 ms, depending on the configured accuracy *(by default, the accuracy is maximum,
The transformation lasts 750 ms)*.If you read the temperature before the end of the transformation, the sensor will return the result of the previous measurement,
Therefore, the examples use a delay or a survey by a timer for 1 second.You can get the temperature using `gettemp ()` [float] or `gettempint ()` [int].
If the accepted data is damaged or the sensor is absent on the line, the function will return the previous successfully read temperature value.
** Note: ** During repeated calls, `gettemp ()` does not request a new temperature from the sensor (long execution of the function),
Instead, she simply returns the previous result until a new request is made `RequestTemp ()`.

In the version of Library 3.5, it became possible to separately request the temperature and determine the correctness of the data obtained, so that only after that read them
And apply in the program - the function `Readtemp ()`.This also allows you to determine the condition of the connection and whether everything is in order with the sensor.
To read temperature, it is recommended to use the design of the type:
```CPP
if (Sensor.Readtemp ()) value = sensor.gettemp ();
// Else error development
```
Where `Readtemp ()` Causes the data from the sensor and returns `true` if they are read correctly.After that, you can pick up the current temperature from `gettemp ()`,
Which no longer requests the temperature from the sensor, but gives the result read in `readtemp ()` result.

### We connect a lot of sensors to one object
In the version of Library 3.9, it became possible to connect as many sensors to one object Microds18b20, without creating an array of objects (as in old versions).
It is necessary to create a two -dimensional array of addresses and transfer it to the library, also indicating the number of sensors on the line (you can maximum if it changes in the process of the program).
This allows you to save a little memory, but you can go further - put an array of sensors in the Progmem so that they do not hang in RAM.
In this case, the initialization looks like this: `Microds18b20 <Pin, ds_addr_mode, quantity>;` or `Microds18b20 <pin, ds_addr_mode, Kolich-in, DS_PROGMEM>;` for Progmem mode.
The addresses are transmitted to `setaddress ()`, and for the survey we simply transmit the sensor index to the same functions as before.See examples *async_read_many_bus *, *async_read_Many_bus_pgm *and documentation section *Methods for the sensors tire *.

P.S.Instead of a resistor at 4.7k, you can use two in parallel by 10k =)

<a id="EXAMPLASX> </A>
The rest of the examples look at ** Examples **!
## one sensor without addressing
```CPP
// One sensor is better to read without addressing, this strongly saves memory
#include <micrrods18b20.h>
Microds18b20 <2> Sensor;

void setup () {
  Serial.Begin (9600);
}

void loop () {
  // Temperature request
  Sensor.requestTemp ();
  
  // Instead of DELAY, use a timer on Millis (), an example async_read
  DELAY (1000);
  
  // Check the success of reading and display
  if (Sensor.Readtemp ()) serial.println (Sensor.gettemp ());
  Else serial.println ("error");
}
```

## several sensors without addressing
```CPP
// 2 and more sensors are unprofitable to use in this mode!But you can

#include <micrrods18b20.h>
// sensors for d2 and d3
Microds18b20 <2> Sensor1;
Microds18b20 <3> Sensor2;

void setup () {
  Serial.Begin (9600);
}

void loop () {
  // Temperature request
  Sensor1.requesttemp ();
  Sensor2.requesttemp ();

  // Instead of DELAY, use a timer on Millis (), an example async_read
  DELAY (1000);

  // The first sensor
  Serial.print ("t1:");
  
  // just display the temperature of the first sensor
  Serial.print (Sensor1.gettemp ());

  // Second sensationK.
  Serial.print (", t2:");
  
  // Check the success of reading and display
  if (Sensor2.Readtemp ()) serial.println (Sensor2.gettemp ());
  Else serial.println ("error");
}
```

## Reading the address
```CPP
#include <micrrods18b20.h>

// only one sensor is connected to the pin!
Microds18b20 <2> Sensor;// Create a thermometer without address on pin D2
uint8_t address [8];// Create an array for the address

void setup () {
  Serial.Begin (9600);
}

void loop () {
  // read the thermometer address in the specified array
  if (Sensor.Readaddress (Address)) {// If successfully, we display
    Serial.print ('{');
    for (uint8_t i = 0; i <8; i ++) {
      Serial.print ("0x");
      Serial.print (address [i], hex);// display the address
      if (i <7) serial.print (",");
    }
    Serial.println ('}');

  } Else serial.println ("Not Connected");
  DELAY (1000);
}
```

## a few sensors with addressing
```CPP
// 2 or more sensors is more profitable to use with addressing on one pin
#include <micrrods18b20.h>
#define ds_pin 2 // PIN for thermometers

// Unique sensors - you can count in the example of Address_read
uint8_t s1_addr [] = {0x28, 0xff, 0xcd, 0x59, 0x51, 0x17, 0x4, 0xfe};
uint8_t s2_addr [] = {0x28, 0xff, 0x36, 0x94, 0x65, 0x15, 0x2, 0x80};

Microds18b20 <ds_pin, s1_addr> sensor1;// Create a thermometer with addressing
Microds18b20 <ds_pin, s2_addr> sensor2;// Create a thermometer with addressing

void setup () {
  Serial.Begin (9600);
}

void loop () {
  // Asynchronous reading of several sensors see async_read_many
  Sensor1.requesttemp ();// Request temperature transformation
  Sensor2.requesttemp ();

  DELAY (1000);// We expect the result
  
  Serial.print ("t1:");
  if (Sensor1.Redtemp ()) serial.println (Sensor1.gettemp ());
  Else serial.println ("error");

  Serial.print ("t2:");
  if (Sensor2.Readtemp ()) serial.println (Sensor2.gettemp ());
  Else serial.println ("error");
}
```

## asynchronous survey packs of sensors
```CPP
// An example of a compact asynchronous survey of sensors on a software timer
// https://alexgyver.ru/lessons/time/

// number of sensors for convenience
#define ds_sensor_amount 5

// Create a two -dimensional array with addresses
uint8_t addr [] [8] = {{
  {0x28, 0xff, 0x78, 0x5b, 0x50, 0x17, 0x4, 0xcf},
  {0x28, 0xff, 0x99, 0x80, 0x50, 0x17, 0x4, 0x4d},
  {0x28, 0xff, 0x53, 0xe5, 0x50, 0x17, 0x4, 0xc3},
  {0x28, 0xff, 0x42, 0x5a, 0x51, 0x17, 0x4, 0xd2},
  {0x28, 0xff, 0xcd, 0x59, 0x51, 0x17, 0x4, 0xfe},
};

#include <micrrods18b20.h>
// specify ds_addr_mode to connect an addressing unit
// and create an array of sensors on pin D2
Microds18b20 <2, ds_addr_mode> sensor [ds_sensor_amount];

void setup () {
  Serial.Begin (9600);
  // Install the addresses
  for (int i = 0; i <ds_sensor_amount; i ++) {
    Sensor [i] .Setaddress (Addr [i]);
  }
}

void loop () {
  // The design of the program timer for 1C
  Static uint32_t tmr;
  if (millis () - tmr> = 1000) {
    TMR = Millis ();

    // We display the readings to the port
    for (int i = 0; i <ds_sensor_amount; i ++) {
      Serial.print (Sensor [i] .gettemp ());
      Serial.print (',');
    }
    Serial.println ();

    // Request new ones
    for (int i = 0; i <ds_sensor_amount; i ++) {
      Sensor [i] .requesttemp ();
    }
  }
}
```
